# Competitive Programming

### General Info
Solution files from Competitive Programming competitions/training problems. Not all competition problems are present.  
Problems that are unfinished will have a `u_` at the beginning of the file name.  
Problems that have been finished but have not been checked will have an `f_` at the beginning of the file name.  
Problems that have been finished and checked will not have an additional character.
All solutions are written by me, solutions from teammates have been moved.
