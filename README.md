# Competitive Programming

### General Info
Solution files from Competitive Programming competitions/training problems. Not all competition problems are present. 
Files starting with `u_` have not been completed, `f_` indicates a solution is complete but has not been checked against test cases. 
All solutions are written by me, solutions from teammates have been moved.  

### README.md files
All competition folders should have a README.md file that gives information about the competition.  
  
Basic README Format:
```
