# Competitive Programming

## General Info
Solution files from competitive programming competitions/training problems. Folders labeled with years contain local/high school competitions. Not all competition problems are present. The prefix `f_` indicates a solution is finished but has not been checked against test cases. All solutions are written by me, solutions from teammates have been moved.

## README files
All high school competition folders should have a README.md file that gives information about the competition.  
  
Basic README Format:
```
**Date:** DD Mmm YYYY  
**Link:** https://www.example.com  
**Team:** Ben Le, Ben A, Ben B  
**Div/Place:** Advanced #
```
